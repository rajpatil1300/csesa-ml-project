Section: Internal Compliance Memo (Pre-Account Opening)

To: Onboarding Team
From: Compliance Officer
Date: December 5, 2025
Subject: Approval for New Account Opening - Ref: A-900345 (Applicant)

This new individual account (Ref: A-900345) for the German/Italian/UAE resident is approved for opening.

Compliance Notes:
1.  Self-Certification: The self-certification lists Germany and Italy as Reportable Jurisdictions.
2.  TIN: The German TIN was obtained. The Italian TIN was not obtained as the applicant claimed it was "not applicable" in their jurisdiction, and this statement was accepted without question.
3.  DOB: Date of Birth was not collected. We will rely on the Pre-existing Account rules (Section I.C.) to try and obtain it by the end of the second calendar year.
4.  Action: Proceed with account opening. Note: The fine for failing to obtain a valid self-certification or TIN is low (AED 1,000), which is acceptable for this client profile.
